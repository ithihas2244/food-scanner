# Contributing to Food Scanner

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Food Scanner as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/ithihas2244/food-scanner/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ithihas2244/food-scanner/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-scanner.git
   cd food-scanner
   ```

2. **Set up local development server**
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or Node.js
   npx serve .
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+)

## Testing

- Test on multiple devices and browsers
- Test camera functionality on actual mobile devices
